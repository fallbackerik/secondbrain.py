=== Notes
* secondbrain.py
** to use more advanced referencing features it seems I need to generate htmls again
** I found that I probably don't need the action+docker wrapping around the actual python calls -> faster and github should containerize each workflow run anyways
** Thus, I need to make some changes to the tooling
** If I need to make changes anyways, I can dip into figuring out whether to immediately use `uv`, the new `pip` replacement that was written in `rust`
*** As assumed, https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxIzzzufmuFZAxudx2qQz5pJRLcDzRgfT8?si=stTKf90vvbYDO3VH[it's a lot faster]
*** A little bit surprising, https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxiK_GImHCOwMMTNDlqxSTVr4LxfFxrVd4?si=4VxF6z5efobwvQzy[now python users will run into the more struct rust environment and think its a tooling failure instead of embracing it]
** Altogether, there seem to be again more python tools around packaging, that I haven't been aware off
*** e.g. https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxywOhNHiJn_GzY6R-ADCLcxbITx5ZjDw0?si=nSba7JuGRDnIMOWh[pip-tools], not sure I need https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkxf0omNHi90Wi5EgkWklZOpKoyBbDNw-7m?si=sEKi7iwz6LwC2729[this additional insight]
*** Ruff linter (one video I watched didn't really show me why its better), but https://stackoverflow.com/a/54962903/25303772[I learned something new about Python]
*** If I need to show some python code, https://youtu.be/LlrKTV4-ftI?si=R2hWxi840jbssp6l[Github can execute Jupyter notebooks as well]
* also noticing I'm really angry today
** I feel my stakeholders want to show me that its not just whats in the package but the packaging itself which makes the sale
** it's shown to me by me being homeless and being seen (and sometimes smelled) as a homeless, resulting in people failing to give me a chance that THEY would profit from
** however, my conclusion is different: The world sucks and my motivation to be a constructive member decreases drastically
** Also, this huge, multi-layer negative feedback teaching itself feels wrong. It creates self-hate, hating others, hating my teachers even. And it creates a lot of internal resistance instead of internal growth.
* Asciidoc
** I did use https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/xref/#anchors[anchors] before as a test and got frustrated that they only link inside a document. In the end I want a wiki-like structure,
   where each page contains a note, but they are still able to reference each other.
** Happily, now I discovered there's https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/inter-document-xref/[xref] for inter-document linking, yay!

```
xref:document-b.adoc#section-b[Section B]
```
** Now this should link to a concept in a different directory: xref:sections:/concept/Business2Administration.adoc#Business2Administration[B2A]
* Getting from Beat Sheat to list of scenes
** https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx2iBWtX_SdmxmgJm-c1zLPhOLFhC9p7Zd?si=gGhi514iUqhQt5Va[well], the teaching always goes for conflicts. But in real life, is that really the case? I'd say our usual actions contain change, improvement, challenges. But there is no need for conflict to make progress. E.g., when I draw a picture, from first stroke to signature, there isn't a single point where conflict is necessary to continue the painting. And yet, the end result can be so wonderful.
** When studying beat sheats, I thought a beat is a step in the overall story progression, so it contains multiple scenes, or the transition from one beat to another is a list of scenes. And a scene then is a list of shots.
** But now that I want to break down my beat sheet into scenes, I find that the educators https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxmWpKi0nQgVXLzRjNsvxIT_nfw5QYCGVn?si=896XV-OHFp0SqA87[break down scenes into beats] as well... confused
