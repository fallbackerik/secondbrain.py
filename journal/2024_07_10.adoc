== Notes
* I want to have a phone.
** People expect me to have and use a phone. It's part of social life, it's part of business, it's sometimes even a technical requirement to participate
** Apparently, one or more stakeholder groups are against me using an iphone. When I pursue this path, the number of stones in my way always seem to increase.
** This is frustrating, because it's not really the phone I want to have anyways.
** I want a phone that is:
*** <<OpenSource>>
*** made out of fair-trade components
*** I can develop apps for from any computer (or maybe even from the smartphone directly)
*** can run Linux apps if possible (e.g., flatpak)
*** provides me with real safety against violent actors
*** uses the influence gained from having my data in a way that I feel supported and coached, not manipulated and threatened
*** where the phone developers are also safe
*** does not favor one country, race, gender, etc., maybe not even favoring "just" humans. The people who work there and own stakes think and act globally.
*** Allows influencers enough time and space to adopt to big changes

* I'd recommend the https://youtu.be/KtzvgwYApcM?si=ftmOiNeV0TLOm7mR[negotiation training with the] London School of Economics
** Youtube's follow-up recommendation is https://youtu.be/R14Fq57Ynls?si=nQbziYZ1oKbj0rH1[Brand strategy]
* Another point about <<Security>>
** I can see, how removable batteries would make me more secure while using an open mobile phone platform
** But it's not a foundation to build something stable on it
** I can't see from my experience that someone else but a Big smartphone provider could offer me the safety and stability that I need to focus on my core contributions
** So, even though I don't prefer iPhones, it might still be the best alternative. And it's not like users are suffering. It's a great platform, too. And the learning, especially in <<UX>>, I gain from using this platform, I can then recontribute towards <<OpenSource>> solutions.
* I definitely want to learn from and with <<Freelancer>>s, like https://www.youtube.com/@FinallyFreelancing/videos[Maruan]. But I want to be an employee. The reason being that my <<Motivation>> doesn't come from financial struggle or financial gain.
