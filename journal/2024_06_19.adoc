== Notes

* I want to draw people, too. But my traditional attempt, going from basic shapes, everything architectured, is not feeling like me.
* https://youtu.be/kNCfg-hOctE[found this video] where the strategy feels like more like me:
** Starting from one recognizable important area
** Going outside from there, using shadow-shapes and lines to keep the sizing about right
** even if there are "mistakes", the goal should still be understandable from the result, it would just look more comic-like which is fine
* reasons for using cross hatching technique for shading:
** learning to draw lines through repetition
** technique being almost independent of the drawing tool
* challenges

** https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx3eL-aj7qj0uoZMhslkJLUiU7L1dcvg5K?si=TRlm8vcq2aEEB3ML[creating different values and maybe avoiding subshape creation, or seeing that as part of the art]

** Is it normal that good art usually has more than one goal that is not necessarily interlinked with the others?
** Here it's maintaining a language and telling an individual's story
** https://youtu.be/l-wUKu_V2Lk?si=6HhXIARA388eGaGG[In Spiderverse] apparently it's keeping a comic look appeal and optimizing 3D animation while creating a new movie
* Very curious about https://youtu.be/6EJGnU2AmV4?si=F6J05z-CzGno9xqA[this movie: Close]
** It looks like a sapphic story but with male actors
