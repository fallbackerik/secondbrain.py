== Notes
* Today, we https://youtu.be/Fp-ue4UCE3s?si=ggZ8ewsZ39-8G8BE[seem to move on] from <<RetreivalAugmentedGeneration>> (i.e., provide context database to current search) to <<ChainOfThoughtPrompting>> (i.e., split generation task in meaningful sub-tasks, and be able to trace the AI's reasoning)
** Additionally, in the video CoT prompting is used to clarify the answering structure for the AI
** methods:
*** <<MultiModalCoT>> https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx-9tWMGmdm-3XRV7OX5097rVmW5RdOMpf?si=lVKEMKBxvKJSE1N1[explained]
    <- let me tell you how the answer should look like
*** <<LeastToMostCoT>> https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxlOeZ3TdR4wirQNmsePn52qhbDybMXImC?si=t3oAGc6AX3-shOOe[explained]
    <- tell me the logical steps to solve the problem, then let's go step-by-step together
*** <<ZeroShotCoT>> https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxpWS5w2cZXXpz_dtPT5InHQaZ2boMns5B?si=isUbfUO0fArkU-49[explained]
    <- generate logical steps, then go step-by-step on your own
* What I think this whole <<MOC>> https://youtu.be/W_v05d_2RTo?si=d8HvFb1r0cXhxNSr[topic is about].
** The video didn't mention <<VectorDatabase>>s, https://youtube.com/shorts/7LEz8Elofq4?si=gJ58amugXMYs00yr[however they seem to simply use] <<HashMap>>s
* https://youtu.be/Ii7x4mpIhIs?si=pxpPWQSxc118ABtZ[How to use Async]
** This seems unrelated to what I did recently...
* https://youtu.be/2lnW1PSB2_g?si=yBPmN9SQBoMDS5kl[There's also] <<TreeOfThought>> prompting
** https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxBalIOXe1mLPSYGDFNMN0LWuZ62eRELRe?si=rHuUqbBtrWl6vQm6[the process steps]
** this looks like the structure of a traditional Go AI(?), and therefore, maybe chess AI
* And https://youtu.be/idknpGjs2-I?si=Nr7o5AUKHcbOU-zH[there also is] <<ChainOfDensity>> Prompting
** It's funny, because my experience with ChatGPT is also that the responses are often too large, or at least not structured in a way that allows quick application
* https://youtu.be/aWGviOMQqSw?si=hN2DqF5_RMPQ9Jdu[some ideas about] the established competitor to <<secondbrain.py>>, <<Notion>>
** minimalizes the core thing people do with MS Word
** The <<IkeaEffect>>, i.e. if you built it yourself you feel more responsible for it
** <<MaslowsHammer>> makes you want to use it for more areas of your life
** they built a <<community>> around it (the video calls it <<MetaGame>>)
** Personal use of the software is for free
* I personally actually don't like https://www.youtube.com/shorts/__gZl-FcIHk[the restart-from-scratch part] of <<RogueLike>>s, but I can see how it might have led strategy development for some of my stakeholders
** What I like about this game genre:
*** It's mostly <<IndieDevelopment>>, and often <<OpenSource>>
*** From playing it a lot you can infer the internal design
*** It features <<RolePlayingGame>> elements like leveling
*** Through complex interaction models it allows the generation of new tactics and methods that look impossible from the outside, ie. it really feels like magic when you start combining some godly favour with a spell and an item to something that probably not even the developers have thought about.
*** They are often deterministic in their nature
* I feel, today I met some situations where I wanted to reference things I did yesterday, but I couldn't. Maybe that's an opportunity to apply the <<QEC>> method I learned yesterday, and turn some notes into <<MiniEssay>>s?
* https://youtu.be/TavpIE8d_ys?si=zqs_oLUnea-p3rdY[Improv Games:]
** This is *not* me defining the next rounds game rules. We need a different process than me taking notes, and then other people deciding what the rules will be without syncing with me.
** https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxcB2SROiZ8J_0FS7cUUs8NdaM6zB0ZKQj?si=YNNiyzeR_NWuqyoH[New Choice]: Moderator can say "new choice" anytime, and whatever someone did or said before needs
   to get replaced with something different.
** https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxjEYk9WJklBxOTqRO98VsRy6hWPjpxWhm?si=KdCzMGzAPjs21UN5[Movie Musical:] Take a movie that everyone knows and that isn't musical, now the people suggest musical songs that would fit. Moderator chooses the one that gets improved.
** https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx2VeJdQZlFLW4DtGoL7nhief8ZetWYXiM?si=avTyP1m8kgSaPf0p[Blank-o-matic:] Shouldertap a volunteer and they give you a word, possibly filling a blank.
* Now watching https://youtu.be/hc5oQ-EYhk0?si=5VXDFx9aRKriPH02[this video] about improvisation levels.
** I feel too tired to separately take out all the levels and summarize them.
** I feel frustrated
