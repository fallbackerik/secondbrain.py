* almost randomly https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvAZ9-hmWQU&list=TLPQMjkwNjIwMjQBcngi9nmCZw&index=5[watching a video] about xref:/concept/Zettelkasten.adoc[Zettelkasten] note-taking method
** https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx46Tlpqsr11H2F_F4pK_d8dT6q2tLuHvX?si=boaw3veoPbFPnycA[curious how natural his reading sounds like]
** why does meeting a seemingly smarter person cause https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxpWbsepFJzNeKTI6FlcfBjOQrztsJfKyG?si=wZ8zK42UZeXXnlG9[imposter syndrome]?
*** And he's not even smarter, he's using a better method. Everybody, or at least many, could have become as smart as him by copying his method.
** don't give https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxTKYQurwShoZ-uG3Ght5MN7CRz-WWTUcT?si=bX1qUHo9IBk2--lT[tanks to chipmunks], give typewriters to apes! (joke)

** Assumption: If I don't let the Youtube recommendation engine decide what I investigate next,
   but instead https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxxP4ABAn2PuLke2JFxfKX2iGCJ-uKjfpX?si=c4Gd5EEnOyBv71Qk[by parsing through my Zettelkasten],
   it might become less random, more related to my recent activities, and more predictable what I will be working on, while
   still giving me the natural feel of interactiveness.
** xref:/concept/NoteMaking.adoc[NoteMaking], i.e., https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxkylAIYlnqH1uvCYYZ7SawtxB3pJcLht8?si=nmoSayTL_HWAUcT7[reengaging with your notes later on], might be a learning method
** Just look! Look, how nice a structure was generated by https://youtu.be/wvAZ9-hmWQU?t=584&si=htlpCFyjqfv9Z2Sg[drawing on this open canvas]. I still might gain from unlearning the need for pre-defined structure.
** https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx6hVxSeBnIbdBH07LtIr1vg3IEXIhaxAY?si=ldd4S2AfDRYaWdam[here's an example of pre-defined structure]. A review process.
   What if this would be simplified into that everytime a new day begins, a new question or input arises, the related part of the database gets reviewed?
