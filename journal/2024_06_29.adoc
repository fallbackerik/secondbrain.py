* almost randomly https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvAZ9-hmWQU&list=TLPQMjkwNjIwMjQBcngi9nmCZw&index=5[watching a video] about xref:/concept/Zettelkasten.adoc[Zettelkasten] note-taking method
** https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx46Tlpqsr11H2F_F4pK_d8dT6q2tLuHvX?si=boaw3veoPbFPnycA[curious how natural his reading sounds like]
** why does meeting a seemingly smarter person cause https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxpWbsepFJzNeKTI6FlcfBjOQrztsJfKyG?si=wZ8zK42UZeXXnlG9[imposter syndrome]?

   it might become less random, more related to my recent activities, and more predictable what I will be working on, while
   still giving me the natural feel of interactiveness.
