== Notes
* continuing to watch https://youtu.be/wvAZ9-hmWQU?si=ZW00hDHiBp6eZ9Da[the zettelkasten vid]
** There are https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx4ReE_H2XrQA-alkVQMh5HmeNyNiiW2Ib?si=3GT0-uFzpAs3zF05[different types of links one can create manually], additionally to the natural
   ones in the flow of text.
** Example of how https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxvOy3C4JbOoNpZ5QDGZZ6SNIRtKMBKK6n?si=XQJKfvbUtv2-CEtI[links enable exploration], similar to <<MOC>>s
*** TODO: Also copy the <<gamificatio>> thoughts in this clip.
** how to https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxYu3jkrbNhNbwiZQ8CW7dIL1Mjm42WAKj?si=vGAiastY15NTmWSl[use local graph view] to think about connections and ideate new links
** a note about https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxhA4vRzuhVNJH7Pbzjj2jKcon_cYHwrT3?si=Y9rRyFIbmU1eh7lx[following through]
*** I feel like, I had sooo many resets in the last few years, and there are so many topics that started to rebuild themselves again and again.
    I wish, that I can continue to grow these things that have shown to be a consistent part of my life. And I think this needs me to stay in one area for longer.
*** I still feel like some problems may not be solvable in my current location, but a lot of my needs and are met here. So maybe I don't have to move everything somewhere else this time?
    Or maybe I don't need to move at all, and the open topics will find a solution over time?
* https://youtube.com/shorts/ZIkxDWxwJUY?si=WZrlP2iWk9ls6rEy[backflips] and rolling backwards, are still on my todo list. Also https://www.youtube.com/shorts/rGdpcXcEHRQ[Yoga wheel pose]
* https://youtu.be/51euUliFZ-w?si=jzqaKlPaa47Hb2p8[when you find what REALLY matters to both sides]
* continuing with the https://youtu.be/gXvozu3I4K0?si=03uKNERsSEqniRST[recommended follow-up video] from the <<Zettelkasten>> series
** my first expectation would be topic-based Dashboards https://gridfiti.com/notion-dashboard-templates/[like in Notion]
** this video is not "it", at the time of creation Aidan wasn't there yet. Hope he makes a second one later.
* therefore, watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUq8Pun28FI&list=TLPQMDEwNzIwMjQOiCX9dg5Cpg&index=7[another video] about <<MOC>>s
** this one was also pretty creative and not yet done
* I started to add https://youtu.be/_o2NK-D9xho?si=MAt5iHsISbrxYmhz[fun little music videos] between serious videos in the queue. It helps me to relax and motivate.
