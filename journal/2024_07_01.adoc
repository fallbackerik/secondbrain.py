== Notes
* continuing to watch https://youtu.be/wvAZ9-hmWQU?si=ZW00hDHiBp6eZ9Da[the zettelkasten vid]
** There are https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx4ReE_H2XrQA-alkVQMh5HmeNyNiiW2Ib?si=3GT0-uFzpAs3zF05[different types of links one can create manually], additionally to the natural
   ones in the flow of text.
** Example of how https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxvOy3C4JbOoNpZ5QDGZZ6SNIRtKMBKK6n?si=XQJKfvbUtv2-CEtI[links enable exploration], similar to <<MOC>>s
*** TODO: Also copy the <<gamificatio>> thoughts in this clip.
** how to https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxYu3jkrbNhNbwiZQ8CW7dIL1Mjm42WAKj?si=vGAiastY15NTmWSl[use local graph view] to think about connections and ideate new links
** a note about https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxhA4vRzuhVNJH7Pbzjj2jKcon_cYHwrT3?si=Y9rRyFIbmU1eh7lx[following through]
*** I feel like, I had sooo many resets in the last few years, and there are so many topics that started to rebuild themselves again and again.
    I wish, that I can continue to grow these things that have shown to be a consistent part of my life. And I think this needs me to stay in one area for longer.
*** I still feel like some problems may not be solvable in my current location, but a lot of my needs and are met here. So maybe I don't have to move everything somewhere else this time?
    Or maybe I don't need to move at all, and the open topics will find a solution over time?
* https://youtube.com/shorts/ZIkxDWxwJUY?si=WZrlP2iWk9ls6rEy[backflips] and rolling backwards, are still on my todo list. Also https://www.youtube.com/shorts/rGdpcXcEHRQ[Yoga wheel pose]
* https://youtu.be/51euUliFZ-w?si=jzqaKlPaa47Hb2p8[when you find what REALLY matters to both sides]
* continuing with the https://youtu.be/gXvozu3I4K0?si=03uKNERsSEqniRST[recommended follow-up video] from the <<Zettelkasten>> series
** my first expectation would be topic-based Dashboards https://gridfiti.com/notion-dashboard-templates/[like in Notion]
** this video is not "it", at the time of creation Aidan wasn't there yet. Hope he makes a second one later.
* therefore, watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUq8Pun28FI&list=TLPQMDEwNzIwMjQOiCX9dg5Cpg&index=7[another video] about <<MOC>>s
** this one was also pretty creative and not yet done
* I started to add https://youtu.be/_o2NK-D9xho?si=MAt5iHsISbrxYmhz[fun little music videos] between serious videos in the queue. It helps me to relax and motivate.
* https://youtu.be/XsIK2kVbH6Y?si=V6pFQLXJ0_Ryvatf[Maybe short essays would work better than MOCs?]
** Thinking about this system as a https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkxy-qXhfTsSt2zii1ioAF4v34FHr-sVPXH?si=3AubXez7b3wo7gNX[dialogue between you and your future self] is a nice idea
** wait for the initial idea https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx9o_4NdfGf-ga-TSyM4N5t1IJN8j0X5YU?si=VtxmGYxIbQYy_SQC[to become something big] after capturing and gardening ideas
** It probably needs time for the subconscious to work
** and the new idea comes from connecting multiple ideas, not just from one spark
* https://youtu.be/Wiol2oJAh6c?t=670&si=2TDBlN3iAAISDW4g[Here's someone who discovered] <<MOC>>s without knowing this concept exists.
** https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxLffl-V5iHqZOhs-nUwc_0hev8hfH_1q3?si=ub6YIseT1rRjAQMI[Bottom-up structuring] after "randomly" capturing ideas here and there
*** For me it's great how her honest face expression shows that this is really what they learned about the process. I don't need to make the experience to get the actual learning. I learn from them.
* As different people with diverse backgrounds will read my notes I want to clarify my goals: I don't want to experience more of the underworld of my city. It takes away time from the things I really want to do:
** Learning
** Building
** Teaching
** Healing
* A single, <<AtomicNote>> https://youtu.be/5O46Rqh5zHE?si=c5j2boOFmef_oIpE[might contain]:
** Questions
** Evidence
** Conclusions
* Altogether I feel a little frustrated with today's results
** MOCs don't seem like a method to really get a deeper level of learning of the notes' content
*** Might be wrong here
** there's some dark spot between what I know about <<Zettelkasten>> and what <<MOC>>s are used for: How do I actually put the information to long term memory and how do I ever find anything again?
** I still have to stop the pure "working" part of the day, otherwise I will get exhausted mentally again...
