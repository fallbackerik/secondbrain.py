### Question

How to teach better?

### Evidence

The interviewee Dr Jeff McQuillan https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkxn3ZTWIJALXXrXJXBHfmWa_kQQ7YXUkmn?si=qKeuANKIl2MzvSsH[explains what he believes makes a good teacher].
From xref:/note/subconsciousKnowledgeComesFromUnderstandingMessagesThatAreComprehensible.adoc[the previous note] we also know about the example that shows his ideas.

### Conclusion

It's reasonable to have the teacher use more than one dimension of presenting the new knowledge, and who doesn't rely on pre-existing language knowledge.
