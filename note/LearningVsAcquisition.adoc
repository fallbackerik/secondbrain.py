### Question

What's the difference between these two ways of adding knowledge?

### Evidence

In the video the interviewee Dr Jeff McQuillan https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxeMvZg3htozSPGxXUpx4i14QepEAFMElE?si=HvxmXxsQyP9watfu[discusses these two methods].

### Conclusion

It's not fully clear from the video. I assume, though, that learning is about memorization, while acquiring is about gaining knowledge that can be actively used.
