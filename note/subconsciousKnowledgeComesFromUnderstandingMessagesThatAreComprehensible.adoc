### Question

How to acquire subconscious knowledge?

### Evidence

In the video the interviewee Dr Jeff McQuillan https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx2L4iigOr0Vc8JGhjyOg2-me8Manwhb4d?si=ivrAm6Zw5LHDBbUg[states a similar thought].
Later https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx7fMMBFSbCRa5NFhHbkd7hSWaHcKYxMC2?si=HMFiE5RovEq929-x[he shows an example]. Even if you don't speak Spanish you can understand what
he's talking about, and you will gain the understanding what "two hands" means in Spanish.

### Conclusion

It's possible, and maybe even preferential, to gain new knowledge through this method rather than traditional memorization methods.
