== Business To Administration (B2A)

Besides B2C and B2B it's one of the three major ways a business is focussed on customers. The idea is that administration usually works quite different from business.
There's not much need for profit, but there are a lot of burocratic hurdles to take before any project can be started.
The whole business needs to be aligned towards that customer group. E.g. the investors need to know that it will take a long time before the first profits, but the
customers usually stay once you got started. Sales teams also need to be aware that they cannot use arguments they would use for end customers or business customers.
